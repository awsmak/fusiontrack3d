# FusionTrack3D

A multi-modal 3D object detection and tracking system that fuses LiDAR point cloud data with camera imagery. This project implements state-of-the-art deep learning techniques for real-time object detection and tracking using sensor fusion.

## Project Overview
This project aims to:
- Process and fuse data from LiDAR and camera sensors
- Perform 2D object detection using camera imagery
- Execute 3D object detection using LiDAR point clouds
- Implement real-time object tracking
- Visualize results in an interpretable format

## Technical Stack
- PyTorch for deep learning models
- Open3D for point cloud processing
- OpenCV for image processing
- KITTI dataset for training and evaluation
